What is the real-world problem you want to tackle?

Every year, nearly 2 million tourists visit the Maldives, but 90% of them never step foot on a local island. They're trapped in resort bubbles, missing the REAL Maldives while spending $3,000+ on generic experiences.

Meanwhile, young Maldivians on local islands: skilled fishermen, freelance divers, boat captains, guides, have zero way to reach these tourists. They watch foreign resort staff profit from OUR culture, OUR waters, OUR islands.

Here's the crazy part: Thailand has Klook. Indonesia has Traveloka. But the Maldives, aka THE world's #1 island destination, has NO dedicated experience platform! Tourists are forced to trust resort concierges, beg Reddit strangers for tips, or overpay on OTAs (Online Travel Agencies) that take 20-40% commission.

Over 1,000 uninhabited islands sit untouched because no tourist can find a local to take them there. The opportunity is RIGHT HERE, but there's no bridge connecting tourists who want authenticity with locals who can provide it.



Why does this problem matter to your community, city/island, or the world? Why do you believe your solution is needed right now?

Tourism is the backbone of our economy (21% of GDP), yet the majority of revenue goes to resorts while local communities see a fraction. This isn't just an economic problem..it's a generational one. Young Maldivians are leaving their islands because they can't earn a living there.

The gig economy has transformed how the world works: Uber, Airbnb, Fiverr created millions of jobs by connecting supply with demand. But NO ONE has built this for Maldivian tourism. If we don't build it ourselves, a foreign company will and they'll take a cut of OUR economy forever.

We believe this is the perfect timing as guesthouse tourism is booming, tourists are demanding authentic experiences, and young Maldivians are more digitally skilled than ever!!



What is your quick idea for solving this problem in a creative way?

TropiGo (name TBD) is an open marketplace where tourists discover and book experiences across ALL the Maldives, and ANYONE can list: local fishermen, local artists, excursion operators, freelance divers, guesthouses, dive centers, AND resorts compete side-by-side.

What makes us different:
- 🏝 Access to 1000+ uninhabited islands where local boat captains list secret spots no resort can take you

- 💸 Skip the middleman tax: resorts mark up local experiences by 50-100%, OTAs take 20-40% commission. We connect you directly to trusted locals. Their price. Your savings.

- 💬 Community Q&A feed replacing chaotic Reddit threads
Verified host profiles with reviews
Immersive previews shot by LOCAL CREATIVES: 360° VR experiences + cinematic trip videos (drone pilots, videographers earn per video)

- 🏺 Cultural QR codes at heritage sites which you could scan directly from the app to hear local elders narrate 50+ years of history

- 🤖 Maldy - AI Trip Planner: Tell Maldy your budget, dates, and vibe → get a personalized itinerary across islands → book the whole trip in one flow. No more Reddit research rabbi holes.

- 🌐 Multi-language & Auto-Translation: App works in 10+ languages. In-app chat and posts auto-translates between tourists and hosts in real-time. Chinese tourist asks a question → Maldivian host reads it in English → replies → tourist sees it in Mandarin. No language barrier, no lost bookings.

We're not just building a booking app. We're creating an entire gig economy ecosystem, where every fisherman, diver, storyteller, and content creator can earn from tourism while preserving the traditions that make the Maldives unique. One platform. Every island. Everyone wins.
